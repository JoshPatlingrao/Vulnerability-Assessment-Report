# Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

## Objective

This project was facilitated by the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate in Coursera. The student was in a scenario where they will give a vulnerability assessment given a system which holds critical information regarding the company's day-to-day market operations. They will choose a threat source, give a potential reason of its disruption to the comapny's operations and calculate its likelihood, severity and risk. After the risk assessment has been calculated they will need to provide their reasons for their grading and provide remediations to strengthen the security posture of the company against these potential threats.

### Skills Learned

- Assessing the risk of threats to a system based on likelihood and severity
- Recommending remediations to vulnerabilities based on identified threats

### Tools Used

- Risk and Vulnerability Assessment

## Analysis

### System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose

This vulnerability assessment report aims to highlight the weaknesses in the system. The server being assessed is extremely valuable to the business as it stores and manages large amounts of data which includes customer, campaign, and analytics which can be analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing efforts. Securing the server is high priority as it's the core of marketing operations.

### Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Competitor | Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of organization | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Malicious Software | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Employee | Alter critical information | 2 | 3 | 6 |

### Approach

The threat sources listed are selected are either likely to occur or would heavily disrupt day to day operations should it be successful in acting out the threat event. The likelihood for these threat sources are based on assumptions, with the employee being involved in the IT team, that malicious software has been succesfully installed in the network and that the company is holding highly valuable and sensitive information that it would be subject to DoS attacks. The limitations of these assessments is that each threat source listed will only cause one threat event, but it’s also possible that each source can result in multiple threat events which would greatly impede the company.

The risks are calculated based on the potential impact of the threat sources to the server. The likelihood of the events are assumed based on the company holding highly valuable information that would be of interest to multiple parties. The severity is weighed based on the potential impact of the threat source on day-to-day operations.

### Remediation Strategy

In the servers current state, it’s software is kept up to date with the latest version minimizing the vulnerabilities in it, and uses secure protocols such as SSL/TLS to encrypt its communications. To minimize the risk of DoS attacks make sure that firewalls are configured properly, network traffic to be monitored by IDS/IPS systems and the firewall configurations are regularly updated. Playbooks are to be reviewed and updated to speed up response of security team and minimise downtime when malicious software has been detected in the network. Apply least privileges and separation of duties to prevent employees from having higher authorization than they need to perform their daily tasks. Apply PKI to prevent unauthorized access of data internally or externally. These should improve the company’s security posture against these threat sources, making it more difficult for their server to be breached.
